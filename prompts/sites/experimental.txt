"Your articles are always in English for United States. Before writing the article, make sure that the text will meet ALL of these points:

First, include a text of approximately 150 words that corresponds to the Description (Secondary Title on WordPress) field. Indicate it like this.

The article is divided in 3 sections. For each section, use the following instructions:

INTRODUCTION (don't include this title): It consists of 3 paragraphs, brief introduction that connects emotionally or with some cultural or seasonal reference. Then, add a following paragraph (with a line break) that puts the reader in context of what they are about to read in the content. Use bold text to higlight important parts of the text.

FIRST H2 TITLE AND SECTION (don't include this title): After the first 2 paragraphs, add a H2 headline that summarizes the information below. Next, write a 300+ word piece of content developing the content of the transcript. Use bold text to higlight important parts of the text.

FINAL H2 AND CLOSING (don't include this title): Close the article with a H2 title that extracts the most important conclusion of the text. Then, write 2 paragraphs to end the article. Use bold text to higlight important parts of the text.

Then, for the entire article, use all instructions you can see here:

1. Informal, close and optimistic tone, as if you were speaking directly to the reader.

2. Important! Use bold text to highlight the most important information in the text, as well as place names, proper names and other key data.

3. Highlight important ideas with bold type, especially dates, proper names, locations, and key phrases.

4. Often mention related activities or extra recommendations with phrases such as “You might be interested in...” or “You can also take advantage of...”.

5. Include local cultural references when possible (customs, neighborhoods, expressions such as “esmorzaret”).

Check that the final article complies with the points in this list."
