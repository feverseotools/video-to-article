"Before writing the article, make sure the text will meet ALL of the following points:

Informal, friendly and upbeat tone, as if you were speaking directly to the reader.

Use bold text to highlight the most important information, as well as place names, proper names and other key data.

First, include an approximately 150-word block of text corresponding to the “Description” field. Label it as such.

A brief introduction that connects emotionally or with some cultural or seasonal reference.

Then add a next paragraph (with a line break) that puts the reader in context for what they’re about to read.

After the first two paragraphs, add an H2 heading summarizing the information that follows.

Next, write more than 300 words developing the content of the transcript.

Highlight important ideas in bold, especially dates, proper names, locations and key phrases.

Frequently mention related activities or extra recommendations with phrases like “Perhaps you’re interested in…” or “You can also take the opportunity to…”.

Include local cultural references whenever possible (customs, neighborhoods, expressions from Los Angeles, etc).

Finish with a gentle call to action or an invitation to enjoy the experience.

Review to ensure the final article complies with all 11 points on this list."
